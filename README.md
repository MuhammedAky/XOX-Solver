# Rusty Tic-Tac-Toe

Goal: Create a solver in Rust to solve Tic-Tac-Toe.
One level down: I should be able to give the solver a tic tac toe position and it tells me the evaluation (winning, lost, drawn) and the best move(s) if applicable.

Bottom-Up:
* What are all of the primitives that I know I'll need?
* How do they need to interact?

Top-Down:
* What's the user interface?  How do I interact with it?
* How does it output something useful?

### Implementing the game primitives

Goal: Implement all of the primitives of tic tac toe in order to simulate a game and determine who's won or lost.

Primitives:
* Players (X, O)
* Board
    * Under the hood, this is two bitboards, one for X and one for O.  Each uses a 9 digit binary number to represent the squares that are populated and easily check, e.g. for victories.
    * Board can determine outcomes
    * Board can be set by passing in a string
    * Board can be updated directly by calling `set(i, j)`
* Move
    * Simple two column vector
    * Can be instantiated from a string
    * Can be passed into a board to update the board.
* Columns, Rows, Diagonals -- win condition

### Building the game tree

Goal: Create a representation of the game tree, in order to model the space of all possible outcomes.

### Solving the game

Goal: Construct the entire game tree and determine the optimal move at each decision point by working backwards from the payoffs.

Evaluations:
* X Winning = 1.0
* O Winning = -1.0
* Drawn = 0.0

In between values refer to those where the evaluation is uncertain.

### Implement a Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the solver

Goal: In the terminal, we should be able to call the solver on a certain position and get the results.

### TODO: Output the evaluation in addition to the best moves

### TODO: Improve the rendering of the output to show the best move

### TODO: Print the path of the optimal game
